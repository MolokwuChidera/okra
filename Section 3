### Problem 1

**Route**

[https://docs.okra.ng/reference/fetchauths](https://docs.okra.ng/reference/fetchauths)

Answer: The type of http call was not provided but based on the actual documentation this is to be a POST call.
The first issue with this request is the url of the route which points to the documentation rather than the actual api endpoint which should be https://api.okra.ng/v2/products/auths and this is why request returned error 404 page not found as there is no such endpoint available.

When a call is made using the correct endpoint it returns authentication with a default limit of 10 as limit was not specified in the payload.


### Problem 2

**Route**

[https://docs.okra.ng/reference/getidentitybydate](https://docs.okra.ng/reference/getidentitybydate)


Answer: The type of http call was not provided but based on the actual documentation this is to be a POST call. There are two issues with this particular request. The first issue is the route being used which points to the documentation instead of the actual api endpoint: https://api.okra.ng/v2/identity/getByDate. This is why when tried via postman it will return an error 404 page not found.

However there is also an issue with the payload being sent. The payload the endpoint is expecting is two parameters: "from" and "to" which point to the date range which is being requested, however what was passed was the "page" payload with a value of 1.

When a call is made using the correct endpoint and a date range of 2022-10-01 to 2022-10-02 it returns a 200 success with the message that no identity is available for the provided date range.
