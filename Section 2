Question 1:
Hey Okra team, I'm trying to get the latest transactions and I'm hitting the
https://api.okra.ng/v2/transactions/getByld but it's only giving me a week old transactions for
some reason. Please help! Jesse

Answer:

Hi jesse, please attempt to call this endpoint(https://api.okra.ng/v2/transactions/refresh) and confirm if you get a 200 response. For only older transactions to be fetched it means the transactions for that account are not updating due to the refresh endpoint failing. If you get a response different from 200 it means there must be an issue with that integration or the bearer token being used is invalid and might need to be changed.
If you run into any further issues kindly reach out as I am available for any follow up questions you might have.


Question 2:
Hi! I've setup the Widget and I can connect the account, however I don't understand how to
programmatically indicate that the connection was successful or it thrown an error. Thanks in
advance. Mike

Answer:
Hi Mike, for an integration to okra api your application needs to be able to handle http status code exceptions. For example a 200 shows a request succeeded and a 201 shows you a successful request, usually a creation request while a 400, 401 or a 500 exception ties to an error in the request made. We advise that you log the request_id of the particular request as you throw the exception to enable easy and faster troubelshooting of an issue when raised.

Question 3:
Hello, my name is Blessing and I would like to understand how do I test Okra. I wouldn't like to
pay for my testing.


Answer

Hi Blessing, Okra has a free fully featured environment that can be used for application development and testing which means you do not need to pay for testing and every feature you would make use of on production is also available on our sandbox environment. To start using Sandbox, you will need to create an account on https://dash.okra.ng. Registration is free, once registered you can use our Sandbox environment to build your integration. On our sadnbox environment you can get dummy data that mimics real-world use cases, test out all the endpoints, use the widget, and implement webhooks - just the same as with real-world data.
